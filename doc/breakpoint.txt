1: General                                                         *Breakpoint*

This plugin allows you to place breakpoints in Vim. These can later be
sourced by GDB.

If there exists a file named `.<filename>_breakpoints` in the same directory
as <file> then Vim loads breakpoint data from that file. If any breakpoints
are set when Vim saves then those are saved to that file. If there are no
breakpoints in the file during a save then the breakpoints file is removed.

The breakpoints file is also formatted as a GDB breakpoints file, allowing GDB
to source it. As well as any GDB breakpoint file to be used for
vim-breakpoint.

Primary distribution and latest version of this plugin should be available at:
    https://github.com/HugoNikanor/vim-breakpoint

2: Vim Usage                                                    *BreakpointVim*

Bindings:

<Plug>BreakpointToggle              toggles breakpoint on current line

I would also recommend the following mapping (or something similar to it): >
	nmap <leader>a <Plug>BreakpointToggle
<

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands:                           *BreakpointSave*    *BreakpointPlace*
                                    *BreakpointLoad*    *BreakpointRemove*
The following commands are available:                 *BreakpointToggle*

`BreakpointPlace  [line]`           Place, remove, or toggle breakpoint.
`BreakpointRemove [line]`           Either on {line} or on current line,
`BreakpointToggle [line]`           if no argument was given.

`BreakpointSave`                    Loads and saves the breakpoints in
`BreakpointLoad`                    the current file. Note that the plugin
                                  already does this saves breakpoints with
                                  every file save.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions:

The following functions are available from vim-breakpoint.
They shouldn't be needed during normal usage, but they are here if
need arises.

`breakpoint#place([line])          ` Places a breakpoint, ether at the
                                   current line, or at the line given
                                   by {line}.

`breakpoint#remove()`                Removes the breakpoint at current line

`breakpoint#toggle()`                Toggles the breakpoint at current line

`breakpoint#save()`                  Saves all breakpoints in current file
                                   to `.breakpoints_<file>` 

`breakpoint#load()`                  Loads all breakpoints from
                                   `.breakpoints_<file>` into Vim.



=============================================================================
3: GDB Usage                                                    *BreakpointGDB*

Vim-breakpoint saves its breakpoints to a file called `.breakpoints_<file>`.
GDB can then source that file, by running (in gdb):
>
    (gdb) source .breakpoints_<file>

=============================================================================
4: Configuration                                             *BreakpointConfig*

Plugin configuration is done in `~/.vim/ftplugin/breakpoint.vim`.
It's possible to change both color and shape.

Example: >
    highlight Breakpoint ctermfg=Yellow
    sign define breakpoint text=<> texthl=Breakpoint
<
Where the ctermfg=Yellow can be changed for a different color, and the text=<>
can be changed for a different symbol. See |:sign| for more information.
=============================================================================
5: Troubleshooting                                          *BreakpointTrouble*

Vim lacks any systems for handling signs between multiple plugins (please
prove me wrong on this). Therefore this plugin has set a prefix of 2000 on all
its signs. If this conflicts with another plugin for you change the prefix: >
    let g:breakpoint#counterOffset = X
<
=============================================================================
6: Known Bugs                                                   *BreakpointBug*

Breakpoints remain even if the line they reside on is deleted. They are then
automatically moved to an adjacent line. The plugin however doesn't realize
this, which makes it behave as it's still on the line with the line number
of the initial placement of the breakpoint.
